title: Rails 2.2, bundler, rack and pow
excerpt: How to set up Ruby on Rails 2.2 with bundler, rack and Pow
---

Yesterday I have upgraded our production server. I updated "rubygems":rubygems to version 1.8.5 and "bundler":bundler to 1.1.pre.5. I also updated "zubibu.com":zubibu 's staging server by uploading quite a few new gems. One of these actions (or all of them together) broke a few old, low-trafic "rails":rails websites. I didn't investigate what exactly did break them. All broken websites had one thing in common - they were so old that they didn't use bunlder to manage gems. 

h3. Bundler

Most of them was written in rails 2.3, so managing them to user bundler was preaty easy. You can "manual":bunlder-rails23 on bundler website how to do it and that simply wokrs. But one of the broken webisetes was running Rails 2.2.2. I googled if such old app can use bundler, but didn't find any answers. So I decided to try it. I started with the "inststructions":bundler-rails23 for rails 2.3 app.

I have added this code to the @config/boot.rb@ file right above the line @Rails.boot!@

{% highlight ruby %}
class Rails::Boot
  def run
    load_initializer

    Rails::Initializer.class_eval do
      def load_gems
        @bundler_loaded ||= Bundler.require :default, Rails.env
      end
    end

    Rails::Initializer.run(:set_load_path)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


Then I created @config/preinitializer.rb@ file

{% highlight ruby %}
begin
  require "rubygems"
  require "bundler"
rescue LoadError
  raise "Could not load the bundler gem. Install it with `gem install bundler`."
end

if Gem::Version.new(Bundler::VERSION) <= Gem::Version.new("0.9.24")
  raise RuntimeError, "Your bundler version is too old for Rails 2.3." +
   "Run `gem install bundler` to upgrade."
end

begin
  # Set up load paths for all bundled gems
  ENV["BUNDLE_GEMFILE"] = File.expand_path("../../Gemfile", __FILE__)
  Bundler.setup
rescue Bundler::GemNotFound
  raise RuntimeError, "Bundler couldn't find some gems." +
    "Did you run `bundle install`?"
end
{% endhighlight %}

And created the @Gemfile@

{% highlight bash %}
$ bundle init
{% endhighlight %}

I copied there all @config.gem@ directives from @confiv/environmet*@ files and lock the gems at the certain versions as the probably wouldn't run with old code.

That would be all from gembundler instructions, so I created a gemset for this faling app and run @bundle install@. When I try to run tests I got this depracation warning:

{% highlight bash %}
rake/rdoctask is deprecated.  Use rdoc/task instead (in RDoc 2.4.2+)
{% endhighlight %}

To get rid of it just replace replace one line in your @Rakefile@

{% highlight ruby %}
# require 'rake/rdoctask'
require 'rdoc/task'
{% endhighlight %}

and add @rdoc@ to your @Gemfile@

{% highlight ruby %}
#...
gem 'rdoc'
{% endhighlight %}

After @bundle install@ all the tests passed. Yay!

h3. Pow & Rack

I run all my rails application using "Pow":pow. This one I wanted to run same as others. I just add a symbolic link in my @~./pow@ folder and visited an .dev url in the browser and I got this message:

!/images/posts/2011-06-16-rails2.2-bunlder-rack-and-pow.textile/pow.png(If you’re using a version of Rails older than 2.3, you’ll need to upgrade first.)!

Not good :(. They advised me to upgrade my application but I realy don't want to do. Before I googled how to upgrade from rails 2.2 to 2.3 I decided to give it a try and just add the @cofnig.ru@ file.

{% highlight ruby %}
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/config/environment'
run ActionController::Dispatcher.new
{% endhighlight %}

Then I vited app's dev url in the browser just to get this message:

{% highlight ruby %}
MissingSourceFile: no such file to load -- rack
{% endhighlight %}

To fix it just add @gem 'rack'@ to your @Gemfile@. Than all works perfectly! Even my old rails 2.2 app.

h3. tl;dr

1. "Bundler":bundler works with rails 2.2 app.
2. "Pow":pow works with rails 2.2 app even if docs says something else
3. If you want to know how - read the whole thing!
