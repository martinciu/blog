excerpt: How to add some magic to static Jekyll blog development.
---

You probably already know "how to blog like a hacker":blogging-like-a-hacker using "Git":git and "Jekyll":jekyll It is realy simple but powerfull way of maintaing personal blog. If you put it's code on the "github":github like "Jeff Kreeftmeijer":jeffs-blog did you can even count on comunity "contribution":pool-request to your own personal blog. How could is that!

If don't use "jekyll":jekyll for you blog you should definetly reconsider that. If you already do use jekyll you probably know that for developemnt you need to run 

{% highlight bash %}
$ jekyll --server
{% endhighlight %}

to set up simple local server that automatically regenarates static files echa time they are changend. If you also use "SASS":sass or "Compass":compass for your stylesheets you need to run in second terminal

{% highlight bash %}
$ sass --watch input-dir:output-dir
{% endhighlight %}

or for "Comapss":comapss

{% highlight bash %}
$ compass watch
{% endhighlight %}

That is preaty annoying to run two processes in two separate terminals. 

h4. Foreman & Procfile

And this is where "Foreman":foreman comes with help. "Foreman":foreman is a process manager for applications with multiple components. It manages Procfile-based applications. We have application with two components so this perfetly fits for our needs. All we need is to add @Procfile@ To make it work install foreman by

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install foreman
{% endhighlight %}

and create @Procfile@ under root directory

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll:  jekyll --server
comapss: compass watch
{% endhighlight %}

To start both processes just type

{% highlight bash %}
$ foreman start
{% endhighlight %}

and you should see smething similar to:
