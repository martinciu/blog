It will be another not very innovative post about a something that probably most Ruby developers already know. Unfortunately I didn’t know about this  before, and I think it will be a quite good form of this blog, that I will be posting things that I’ve recently learned. So here is what I’ve learned today.

@Proc.new@ and @lambda@ does almost the same job. They provide a dynamically created inline method. But they are slightly different. What are the differences? There are two (as far as I know at the moment)

h3. 1. Acceptance of parameters

@Proc.new@ doesn’t care how many parameter do you provide, when @lambda@ needs exact number of parameters. Example:

{% highlight ruby %}
pr = Proc.new {|a,b,c| puts a,b,c}
pr.call(1, 2, 3, 4)
# 1
# 2
# 3
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
pr = lambda {|a,b,c| puts a,b,c}
pr.call(1, 2, 3, 4)
# ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (4 for 3)
{% endhighlight %}

h3. 2. Returning from a proc
@return@ called in @Proc.new@ block returns from enclosing method when return called in @lambda@ block returns from just a block.
Examples:

{% highlight ruby %}
def my_method
  puts "Starting my_method"
  pr = Proc.new {return}
  pr.call
  puts "Finishing my_method"
end
 
puts "Before my_method"
my_method
puts "After my_method"
# Before my_method
# Starting my_method
# After my_method
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
def my_method
  puts "Starting my_method"
  pr = lambda {return}
  pr.call
  puts "Finishing my_method"
end
 
puts "Before my_method"
my_method
puts "After my_method"
# Before my_method
# Starting my_method
# Finishing my_method
# After my_method
{% endhighlight %}

The other thing that is worth mentioning is that there exist an instruction called @proc@. What is wired, it works different in ruby 1.8 and in version 1.9. In Ruby 1.8 proc behaviors like @lambda@ when in Ruby 1.9 it works like @Proc.ne@w. Because of this, and because of ruumors that proc instruction will be removed in ruby 2.0, I don’t recommend using it in your code.
