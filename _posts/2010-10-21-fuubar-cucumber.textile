excerpt: The instafailing Cucumber progress bar formatter
---
A few days ago "Jeff Kreeftmeijer":jeff_kreeftmeijer released "Fuubar: the instafailing RSpec progress bar formatter":fuubar. It is great, and I use it as default formatter in all my projects. As I started to use it I realised that it would be great to have similar formatter for "Cucumber":cucumber. At first I wanted to add cucuber formatter class to "Jeff’s gem":foobar_gem, but later I decided to make it a separet gam because of gem dependencies.

This is where "fuubar-cucumber":fuubar_cucumber came from. Installation is simple. Just add it to your gem file:

{% highlight ruby %}

gem 'fuubar-cucumber'

{% endhighlight %}

or install manualy

{% highlight bash %}

$ gem install fuubar-cucumber

{% endhighlight %}
and from now on you can run your cucumber features with ‘–format Cucumber::Formatter::Fuubar’ option. Hope you find it useful.
